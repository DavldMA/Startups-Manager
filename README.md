# Startup Directory Project

This project is a learning endeavor created during an internship for [Albatroz Digital](https://github.com/albatrozdigital) to explore TypeScript, Fastify, React, and Ant Design (Antd) frameworks. The project aims to build a RESTful API using Fastify in TypeScript for backend operations, and a frontend interface using React with Antd components.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Provides functionalities for user registration, login, and logout.
- **Startup Listings**: Allows users to view a list of startups.
- **Favorite Startups**: Users can mark startups as favorites.
- **Admin Utilities**: Admins can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on startups, including adding, editing, and deleting startups.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Typed superset of JavaScript.
  - [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/): Web framework for building efficient and scalable web applications.
  
- **Frontend**:
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - [Ant Design (Antd)](https://ant.design/): A React UI library with a set of high-quality components and themes.
